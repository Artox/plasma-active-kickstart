The image creation has to be done inside the Mer chroot environment

1) create the kickstarts:
mer-kickstarter mer-kickstarter -e . -c releases/plasma-active-4.yaml -o plasma-active-latest-ks/

2) create the image:
cd plasma-active-latest-ks/
sudo mic create livecd plasma-active-i586.ks -o . --pkgmgr=zypp --arch=i686 --logfile=plasma-active-build.log


Note about WeTab:

The original weTab had a bios that required a partivular sequence at the beginning of the image.
If you are preparing an image for such device, you can do:

printf "\x9d\x2a\x44\x7b"|dd of=plasma-active-i586.iso conv=notrunc bs=1 count=4 seek=440
